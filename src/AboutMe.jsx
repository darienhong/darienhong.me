                "How does this work?", "How do I solve this problem?", "Why do I like how this looks?". 
                At McGill University, I study the uses of computers and programming languages, while 
                developing technical skills and a new perspective on problem solving. I enjoy helping people find technical solutions to their real world problems.
                In the process of 
                solving problems or the development of new ideas, I also take into consideration how <i>nice </i> 
                something looks. Design for me is a way to bring my ideas to life in a creative and meaningful 
                 way that resonates with people. </p>

               I was born in New Jersey, USA and moved to Toronto, Canada when I was 6. Now, I've found 
                my way to Montreal to study <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Computer Science
                </a> at McGill University. What may be interesting 
                to you is how I originally applied to study Psychology, with no background in science at all, but found 
                myself gravitating towards computers, math and weird code. This competitive undergraduate 
                program has armed me with a pocket of very practical analytical and technical hard skills, 
                as well as opened doors for me to explore my creative side and has let me consider the endless 
                career possibilities, as technology is constantly evolving in almost every industry.

                          When I'm not at the library hunched over my laptop or pulling all-nighters at <span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}><Link to="/Projects"> Hackathons</Link></span> (pre-covid), you
                can find me exploring the city, taking a nice walk to the park or cooking up a storm in the 
                kitchen. I've recently picked up writing <a href="https://darienhong.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogs</a> as a form of expressing myself and sharing my experiences with other people; 
                check out my four-part University series! I consider myself a curious person, and I'm always looking 
                for new passions to explore, new foods to try, new things to learn, and new ways to improve myself.
